                In summary, Christopher ISRAEL was born in 1997 in a beautiful town called <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fort-Libert%C3%A9,+Hait%C3%AD/@19.663623,-71.8445564,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x8eb131499ae7f761:0x1d99d3d5b7e0c250!8m2!3d19.6616066!4d-71.8363794!16zL20vMGNrcF95" target="_blank">Fort-Liberté (Haiti)</a>, he finished his secondary studies in 2016. He wanted to study computer engineering but due to a socio-political problem and insecurity he had to leave his country at the end of the 2017 destination Chile. From there he started working in a tourist complex <a href="https://www.patagoniafutaleufu.cl/" target="_blank"><i>(Cabaña Rio Espolon)</i></a> in the south of Chile in a beautiful town called <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Futaleufu,+Futaleuf%C3%BA,+Los+Lagos/@-43.1872342,-71.8776954,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x961e765652f4e2c9:0x68c917d5009905fd!8m2!3d-43.1861986!4d-71.8675639!16s%2Fm%2F0463bsy" target="_blank">Futaleufú</a> and later for the same company he worked in a store in the same town, he is very passionate about basketball. <br>
                In all these time that he was working he was always looking for something to learn that he has a link with as a computer engineer but he was never able to finish any of these courses. Since he was alone there, he decided to leave the town and go live in another where he would be closer to some of the families he has in Chile and while that he kept looking for courses on the internet until he found the <a href="https://platzi.com/" target="_blank">PLATZI.com</a> school. Since in that school there are all kinds of technology courses, decide to follow a web developer path and want to specialize in creating mobile apps.
